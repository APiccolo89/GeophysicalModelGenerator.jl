# Tutorials

The best way to learn how to use julia and GeophysicalModelGenerator to visualize your data is to look at the tutorials.

1. [3D seismic tomography data on regular grid](./man/tutorial_load3DSeismicData.md). Demonstrates how to load 3D data that are defined on a regular longitude/latitude/depth grid.
2. [3D seismic tomography data on irregular grid](./man/tutorial_loadirregular3DSeismicData.md). Shows how to interpolate 3D seismic data, given on an irregular lon/lat grid, to a regular grid and create Paraview input from it.
